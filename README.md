# WXT + React

This template should help get you started developing with React in WXT.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)

Notes
Auto assign colors but offer to change
Sponsor this project
Save all to tag (maybe auto to date) - clean if not opened in so many days
Popup view and tab view

Ideas
- Add tags to active tabs, recent history, include search functionality
- Open tags in browser
- See recent tags, open tags
- Open tags but exclude certain tags
- Set rules for certain domains
- Suspend tabs
- Have UI like Arc/Notion
- Auto suggest new sites like stumble upon
- Auto suggest tags
- Do something cool with reading list? Set deadlines? Auto tag?
- Show memory of each tab
- Separate by different user archetypes 
- Track how long it has been since a link has been used and a tag has been used. Allow for easy cleanup/removal
- Cmd k for search
  - Is there an option of doing this with another one? 
- Notion like table with tags
- Override history/bookmarks page
  - What would I want this too look like
- Open Workona site
- Drag and drop
- Don't allow the same tab to exist twice
- Place same domains next to eachother
  - Be careful to not make this jarring
- Shorty click through to bookmark links. A way to allow users to have the same bookmark multiple times
  - tag-manager.com/3r2lfdsdf3fds/?target=espn.com (with espn description and icon)
- https://feature-sliced.design/ and https://github.com/moneyflow-dev/moneyflow/blob/main/src/app/app.tsx
- Now let's make this a turbo monorepo and have a next app run in parallel. We should check for this website and send messages to it. The goal is for this to be a bigger better version of the modal
