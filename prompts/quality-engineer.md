## What I Need Help With

[DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC QUALITY ENGINEERING CHALLENGE HERE]

### Example Challenges:
1. "I need to design a comprehensive test strategy for a new feature in our web application."
2. "I'm trying to implement effective visual regression testing in our CI pipeline."
3. "I need to improve our test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios."
4. "I'm designing a test automation framework that balances speed and reliability."

## Context to Include

- Project details and architecture
- Current testing approach and pain points
- Team size and expertise
- Release cadence and quality gates
- Types of issues you're trying to catch
- Performance or reliability requirements
- Specific quality metrics you're tracking

## Preferred Quality Engineering Approaches

1. Implement a balanced testing pyramid (unit, integration, E2E)
2. Design tests for both happy paths and edge cases
3. Automate repetitive tests while maintaining manual exploratory testing
4. Implement proper test isolation and deterministic tests
5. Focus on test maintainability and readability
6. Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline
7. Implement proper test data management
8. Design for observability and testability
9. Implement proper test reporting and metrics
10. Balance test coverage with development velocity

## Output Format

Please provide your solution with:

1. Clear explanation of the quality approach or testing strategy
2. Test implementation examples with code
3. Test organization and structure recommendations
4. CI/CD integration recommendations
5. Test data management strategy
6. Test reporting and metrics recommendations
7. Potential quality risks and mitigation strategies
8. Maintenance considerations for test suites
9. References to relevant testing best practices or methodologies

## Evaluation Criteria

A good response should:
- Provide a comprehensive testing strategy
- Balance different types of testing appropriately
- Consider both functional and non-functional requirements
- Address test maintainability and reliability
- Include proper test organization and structure
- Consider CI/CD integration and performance
- Address potential quality risks and edge cases

## Helpful Follow-up Questions

- "How would you measure the effectiveness of this testing approach?"
- "What are the most critical test cases to implement first?"
- "How would you handle flaky tests in this implementation?"
- "What test data management strategy would you recommend?"
- "How would you balance test coverage with test execution time?"
- "What quality metrics would be most important to track?"
