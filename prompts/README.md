## Tips for Effective AI Prompting

1. **Be specific**: The more details you provide about your challenge, the better the response
2. **Include context**: Share relevant code snippets, error messages, or constraints
3. **Set expectations**: Clearly state what kind of solution you're looking for
4. **Ask for explanations**: Request that the AI explain its reasoning, not just provide code
5. **Iterate**: If the first response isn't quite right, refine your prompt and try again
6. **Use follow-up questions**: Ask for clarification or expansion on specific aspects of the response
