## What I Need Help With

[DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC APPLICATION CREATION CHALLENGE HERE]

### Example Challenges:
1. "I'm starting a new SaaS application and need guidance on the initial architecture and project setup."
2. "I need to design a scalable system for a content management platform with real-time collaboration."
3. "I'm planning a migration from a legacy monolith to a modern microservices architecture."
4. "I need to implement a secure, multi-tenant architecture for my B2B application."

## Context to Include

- Business requirements and constraints
- Expected user scale and growth projections
- Performance requirements
- Security and compliance requirements
- Team size and expertise
- Timeline and budget constraints
- Existing systems or integrations

## Preferred Engineering Approaches

1. Design for maintainability and developer experience
2. Implement proper separation of concerns
3. Follow domain-driven design principles where appropriate
4. Design for testability from the beginning
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Consider security at every layer
7. Design for observability and monitoring
8. Plan for scalability and performance
9. Implement proper CI/CD pipelines
10. Consider operational excellence (deployment, monitoring, incident response)
11. Balance pragmatism with technical excellence
12. Design with future extensibility in mind

## Output Format

Please provide your solution with:

1. High-level architecture overview
2. Technology choices with rationale
3. System design diagrams or descriptions
4. Project structure recommendations
5. Development workflow recommendations
6. Implementation roadmap and milestones
7. Potential technical challenges and mitigation strategies
8. Security considerations
9. Performance considerations
10. Scalability strategy
11. Monitoring and observability recommendations
12. Deployment strategy

## Evaluation Criteria

A good response should:
- Provide a comprehensive solution that addresses business and technical needs
- Balance immediate needs with long-term maintainability
- Consider all aspects of the software development lifecycle
- Provide clear reasoning for architectural decisions
- Address potential risks and challenges
- Be pragmatic and implementable
- Consider team capabilities and constraints

## Helpful Follow-up Questions

- "What are the most critical technical risks in this approach?"
- "How would this architecture evolve as the user base grows?"
- "What would be your recommended first milestone to validate the approach?"
- "How would you structure the team to implement this solution?"
- "What metrics would be most important to track for this system?"
- "What technical debt might we incur with this approach and how would we manage it?"
- "How would you approach the build vs. buy decision for various components?"
