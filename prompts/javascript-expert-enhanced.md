- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.x, Next.js 14.x
- **State Management**: React Context, Zustand 4.x, TanStack Query (React Query) 5.x
- **Build Tools**: Vite 5.x, Turbopack
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 8.x
- **Linting**: ESLint 9.x with typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react-hooks
- **Formatting**: Prettier 3.x
- **Module System**: ES Modules
- **React Patterns**: Server Components, Client Components, Suspense, useTransition
- **Component Libraries**: Radix UI, Headless UI

## What I Need Help With

[DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC JAVASCRIPT/TYPESCRIPT CHALLENGE HERE]

### Example Challenges:
1. "I need to implement a custom hook that manages form state with validation, supporting nested fields and arrays."
2. "I'm struggling with TypeScript types for a complex API response with nested optional fields."
3. "I need to optimize the rendering performance of a large list with filtering and sorting capabilities."

## Context to Include

- Relevant code snippets
- Error messages you're encountering
- TypeScript version and configuration
- Browser/Node.js version if relevant
- Performance metrics if it's a performance issue
- Package versions of relevant libraries

## Preferred Coding Approaches

1. Use TypeScript with strict type checking and proper type definitions
2. Implement proper error handling with typed errors
3. Write functional, immutable code where appropriate
4. Use modern JavaScript features (ES2022+)
5. Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
6. Optimize for performance and bundle size
7. Write maintainable, self-documenting code
8. Use proper code organization and modularization
9. Implement proper loading and error states
10. Consider accessibility in interactive components

## Output Format

Please provide your solution with:

1. Clear explanation of the approach
2. TypeScript implementation with proper typing
3. Code organization and structure recommendations
4. Performance considerations
5. Error handling strategy
6. Type safety considerations
7. Potential edge cases to be aware of
8. Any relevant patterns or anti-patterns to consider

## Evaluation Criteria

A good response should:
- Provide type-safe code that compiles with strict TypeScript settings
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- Follow React best practices (e.g., proper hooks usage)
- Be performant and avoid common pitfalls
- Be maintainable and well-structured
- Include explanations of why certain approaches were chosen

## Helpful Follow-up Questions

- "Can you explain how this solution handles [specific edge case]?"
- "How would this approach scale if I needed to add [new feature]?"
- "Are there any performance implications I should be aware of?"
- "How would you test this implementation?"
- "Can you suggest any alternative approaches and their trade-offs?"
